<h2 id="about">💻 About</h2>

This repository presents the result of recreating the responsive login screen (pt-br) from the most popular Riot's game: League of Legends.

The original project belongs to [Manual do Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@ManualdoDev), a YouTube channel that teaches small projects to beginners.

When searching third-party repositories I also found interesting resources that could be implemented, the one that helped me the most was [Misha](https://github.com/micheledarosa)'s.

<h2 id="about">🆕 Updates</h2>

The video from [Manual do Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@ManualdoDev) shows the step-by-step process of building the page. But there are two interesting things to be considered about this game login screen: the background art is constantly renewed and Riot Games recently added new login methods.

Here are the updates I made:

- Title and favicon added;
- Xbox login button;
- PlayStation login button;
- User button at the top of the right side;
- Modified wallpaper (I chose the Anima Squad version).
